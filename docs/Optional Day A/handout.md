# OOP Foundations - Reference Handout

## What You'll Learn Today
Today we'll dive deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals in Java. You'll learn how to create well-structured classes, work with different types of constructors, and understand how to properly organize your code using access modifiers.

## Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects
- Class structure and components
- Creating objects (instantiation)
- The `this` keyword
- Object state and behavior

### Constructors
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor overloading
- Constructor chaining

### Instance vs Static
- Instance variables and methods
- Static variables and methods
- When to use each
- The `static` keyword

### Access Modifiers & Encapsulation
- Public, private, protected
- Package-level access
- Getter and setter methods
- Encapsulation principles

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Building a Student Class
Create a `Student` class with:
- Private fields for name, ID, and grades
- Multiple constructors
- Getter/setter methods
- A method to calculate average grade

### Exercise 2: Static Members
Create a `School` class with:
- Static counter for total students
- Instance fields for school details
- Methods that use both static and instance members

### Exercise 3: Class Hierarchies
Design classes for a simple library system:
- Base class for library items
- Specific classes for books, magazines, etc.
- Proper use of access modifiers

## Notes
- Ask questions whenever you need clarification
- Take breaks when needed
- Focus on understanding concepts over memorizing syntax
- Keep your code organized and well-documented
