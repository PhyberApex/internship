# Project Kickoff - Reference Handout

## What You'll Do Today
- Choose and plan your own Java project
- Break down your project into smaller tasks
- Set up your project in the IDE
- Start building your first feature

---

## Project Planning
- **Pick an idea:** What do you want to build? (Game, tool, tracker, etc.)
- **Define features:** What should your program do?
- **Break it down:** List the main parts (classes, methods)

### Example:
**Project:** Simple To-Do List
- Features: Add task, remove task, view tasks
- Classes: ToDoList, Task
- Methods: addTask(), removeTask(), showTasks()

---

## Setting Up Your Project
- Create a new project in IntelliJ IDEA
- Make folders for your code (e.g., src/)
- Create your main class (e.g., ToDoListApp)

---

## Version Control (Git Basics)
- **Why use Git?**
    - Save your progress
    - Go back if you make mistakes
    - Work like real developers
- **Basic commands:**
    - `git init` (start a repo)
    - `git add .` (stage changes)
    - `git commit -m "message"` (save changes)

---

## Start Coding!
- Begin with your main class or first feature
- Test your code as you go
- Ask for help if you get stuck

---

## Mini-Exercises
1. Write a method for your first feature
2. Test your method with sample data
3. Commit your changes to Git

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Code won't run:** Check for typos and errors
- **Feature too big:** Break it into smaller steps
- **Stuck?** Ask your mentor for help

---

## End of Day Checklist

- [ ] Set up project in IDE
- [ ] Started coding first feature
- [ ] Used Git to save progress
- [ ] Participated in meeting

---

## Homework (Optional)
**Research:** Find an example of a similar project online
