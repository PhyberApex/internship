# Advanced OOP - Reference Handout

## What You'll Learn Today
Today we'll explore advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. You'll learn about inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and basic design patterns. We'll apply these concepts in a mini-project to solidify your understanding.

## Key Concepts

### Inheritance
- Extending classes
- The `extends` keyword
- Method overriding
- The `super` keyword
- Types of inheritance

### Interfaces
- Creating and implementing interfaces
- The `implements` keyword
- Default methods
- Multiple interface implementation
- When to use interfaces vs inheritance

### Polymorphism
- Method overriding vs overloading
- Runtime polymorphism
- Type casting
- instanceof operator
- Abstract methods and classes

### Basic Design Patterns
- Singleton pattern
- Factory pattern
- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern
- When to use each pattern

## Mini-Project: Animal Kingdom Simulator
Create a simple simulation with:
- Base Animal class
- Different animal types (inheritance)
- Behavior interfaces
- Polymorphic method calls
- At least one design pattern

### Project Requirements
1. Create hierarchy of animal classes
2. Implement movement and sound interfaces
3. Use polymorphism for animal behaviors
4. Apply a design pattern of your choice
5. Add simple documentation

## Additional Resources
- Java Documentation on Inheritance
- Design Patterns reference
- Online Java Visualizer
- Sample code and solutions

## Notes
- Focus on understanding the concepts
- Ask questions about real-world applications
- Take breaks when needed
- Keep your code clean and organized
- Document your design decisions
