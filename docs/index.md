# Java & Project Experience

## Overview
Welcome to your internship! Over the next 8 days, you'll dive into Java programming, participate in a volunteering day, work on a real project, and finish by presenting your achievements. This plan is flexible and interactive, with hands-on coding, discussions, and opportunities to ask questions. Meetings and activities may shift based on your interests and progress.

## Structure at a Glance
- **Days 1–3:** Java Fundamentals (core concepts, hands-on coding, dynamic Q&A)
- **Day 4:** Volunteering (VTO) + Optional 1–2 hours of Java
- **Day 5:** Java Fundamentals (continue learning and practice)
- **Optional Days:** Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (if ahead of schedule)
- **Days 6–7:** Guided Project Work (apply your skills, build something real)
- **Day 8:** Project Completion & Presentation (finish project, prepare, and present)

  - Small daily challenges
  - Code reviews and troubleshooting
  - Dynamic discussions based on your questions and interests

### Day 4: Volunteering (VTO) + Optional Java
- **Goal:** Participate in a volunteering activity outside the office. If time allows, spend 1–2 hours on Java review or exercises.
- **Activities:**
  - Volunteering work (main focus)
  - Optional: Java review, catch-up, or mini-exercises

### Day 5: Java Fundamentals (continued)
- **Goal:** Continue building Java skills and wrap up core concepts.
- **Activities:**
  - Complete any unfinished fundamentals
  - Deeper dive into OOP or advanced topics as time allows
  - Prepare for project work

### Optional OOP Deep-Dive Days
If you're progressing quickly, we can explore these advanced OOP topics before starting your project:

#### Optional Day A: OOP Foundations
- **Goal:** Master core OOP concepts through hands-on practice
- **Topics:**
  - Classes and Objects in depth

  - Inheritance and composition
  - Abstract classes and interfaces
  - Polymorphism in practice
  - Basic design patterns
  - Mini-project applying OOP concepts

### Days 6–7: Project Work
- **Goal:** Apply your Java knowledge to a small, meaningful project of your choice (with guidance).
- **Activities:**
  - Brainstorm and select a project idea
  - Plan features and break down tasks
  - Implement, test, and refine your project
  - Regular check-ins and feedback

### Day 8: Project Completion & Presentation
- **Goal:** Finish your project, prepare a short presentation, and share your work.
- **Activities:**
  - Finalize project features
  - Prepare slides or a demo
  - Practice and deliver your presentation
  - Receive feedback and celebrate your progress!
